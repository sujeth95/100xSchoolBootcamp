# Expense-Lens

## Overview
Build an Expense-Lens application that tracks and manages user expenses.

Users should be able to add transactions with an amount, description, and category.  
Display all transactions in a structured list or table format.

The total balance should automatically update as items are added or removed.  
Include a filter dropdown to view expenses by category.

Optionally, integrate Chart.js to display a pie chart visualizing spending distribution.

## Requirements
- Add and delete transactions dynamically  
- Calculate and update total balance in real time  
- Implement category-based filtering  
- Manage structured expense state cleanly  
- Ensure responsive dashboard layout  

The UI should resemble a clean financial dashboard layout.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
