# Weather Theme Switcher

## Overview
Build a Weather Theme Switcher application that updates its theme based on real-time weather conditions.

Users should enter a city name, and the application must fetch weather data from a public weather API.  
The background should dynamically change according to the weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, night, etc.).

Display the current temperature and a weather icon.  
Include an option for users to override the automatic theme with a custom background color.

## Requirements
- Fetch weather data using a public API  
- Handle loading and error states  
- Dynamically update background based on weather conditions  
- Provide a custom color override option  
- Ensure responsive layout  

The UI should resemble a clean weather dashboard.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
