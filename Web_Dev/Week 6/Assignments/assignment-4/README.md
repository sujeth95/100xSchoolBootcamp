# Assignment 4: JavaScript & DOM Mastery

This repository contains a collection of nine mini-projects built using **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. These projects are designed to take a student from basic UI manipulation to advanced state management and browser API usage without the help of external libraries.

## Project Categories

The projects are organized by technical complexity, focusing on different aspects of the JavaScript ecosystem.

| Difficulty | Project | Core Technical Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Easy** | **[Flashcard App](./easy/flashcard-app)** | CSS 3D Transforms & Basic Array Logic |
| **Easy** | **[Movie Explorer](./easy/movie-explorer)** | Basic API Fetching (Read-Only) |
| **Easy** | **[Recipe Finder](./easy/recipe-finder)** | URL Parameters & Modal Implementations |
| **Medium** | **[Expense-Lens](./medium/expense-lens)** | Math Logic & Dynamic List (CRUD) |
| **Medium** | **[Crypto-Tracker](./hard/crypto-tracker)** | Real-time Data Formatting & Async/Await |
| **Medium** | **[Weather Switcher](./medium/weather-switcher)** | Conditional Theming & Dynamic CSS Variables |
| **Medium+** | **[Meme Generator](./medium/meme-generator)** | HTML5 Canvas API & Image Processing |
| **Hard** | **[Habit Tracker](./hard/habit-tracker)** | Native Drag-and-Drop API & LocalStorage |
| **Hard** | **[Resume Builder](./hard/resume-builder)** | Real-time State Sync & Complex DOM Updates |

## Learning Objectives

* **Asynchronous JS**: Mastering the `fetch()` API and handling JSON data from public servers.
* **State Management**: Learning how to keep the UI in sync with underlying data objects without a framework.
* **Browser APIs**: Utilizing the Canvas API for graphics and the Drag-and-Drop API for interactive boards.
* **Logic & Formatting**: Implementing real-world features like currency formatting, search filtering, and unit conversion.
* **Persistence**: Using `LocalStorage` to save user data across browser refreshes.

## Getting Started

To view or work on a project, navigate to the specific directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
# Example: Start with an easy project
cd easy/movie-explorer

# Example: Move to a hard project
cd hard/resume-builder

```

## Requirements

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
* A code editor (VS Code recommended).
