# Crypto-Tracker

## Overview
Build a Crypto-Tracker dashboard that displays live cryptocurrency prices.

Fetch data from the CoinGecko API and display the top cryptocurrencies in a structured table or card layout.  
Users should be able to search cryptocurrencies in real time.

Provide a toggle to switch between currencies such as USD, EUR, and INR.  
Style the 24-hour price change dynamically — green for positive values and red for negative values.

## Requirements
- Fetch live data from CoinGecko API  
- Implement real-time search filtering  
- Add currency toggle functionality  
- Apply conditional styling for price changes  
- Handle loading and error states  

The UI should resemble a modern dashboard layout.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
