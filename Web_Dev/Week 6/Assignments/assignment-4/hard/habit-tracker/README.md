# Habit Tracker (Drag-Drop)

## Overview
Build a Habit Tracker application with drag-and-drop functionality to manage daily routines.

Create categories such as Morning, Work, and Evening.  
Users should be able to drag habits between columns labeled “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”

Allow users to add and remove habits dynamically.  
Optionally, use LocalStorage to persist data after page refresh.

## Requirements
- Implement drag-and-drop between columns  
- Maintain synchronized state across categories  
- Support dynamic habit creation and deletion  
- Persist data using LocalStorage (optional)  
- Ensure responsive layout  

The UI should resemble a clean productivity board layout.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
