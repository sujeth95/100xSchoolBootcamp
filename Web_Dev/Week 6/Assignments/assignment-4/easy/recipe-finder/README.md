# Recipe Finder

## Overview
Build a Recipe Finder application that allows users to explore recipes based on cuisine preferences.

Users should select a cuisine type and enter the number of recipes to display.  
Use a public recipe API to fetch data dynamically.

Render recipe cards showing the image, title, and a brief description.  
Optionally, allow users to view full details in a modal or separate section.

## Requirements
- Fetch data using a public recipe API  
- Handle loading and error states  
- Render responsive recipe cards  
- Support cuisine selection and result limit  
- Ensure clean state management  

The UI should resemble a modern food browsing interface.  
## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
