# Movie Explorer App

## Overview
Build a Movie Explorer application that allows users to browse movies based on their preferences.

Users should select a genre and enter the number of movies to display.  
Use a public movie API (such as TMDB) to fetch data and render movie cards dynamically.

Each movie card should display the poster, title, rating, and overview.  
Include a “Sort by Rating” toggle feature to reorder the results.

## Requirements
- Fetch data using a public movie API  
- Handle loading and error states  
- Implement sorting functionality  
- Use a responsive card-based layout  

The UI should resemble a modern streaming-style layout.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
