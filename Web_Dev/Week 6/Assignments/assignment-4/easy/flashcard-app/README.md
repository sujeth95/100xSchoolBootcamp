# Flashcard Learning App

## Overview
Build a Flashcard Learning application that helps users practice different topics interactively.

Users should select a topic and choose the number of questions to attempt.  
The application should render flashcards one by one with a flip animation to reveal the answer.

After completing all flashcards, display the final score based on correct responses.

## Requirements
- Allow topic selection and question count input  
- Implement flip animation for each flashcard  
- Track user answers and calculate score  
- Display results after completion  
- Ensure responsive layout  

The UI should resemble an interactive learning interface.  

## UI Note
You are expected to design the interface independently while meeting all functional requirements.
