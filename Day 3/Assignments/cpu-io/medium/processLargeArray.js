// Problem Description – Non-Blocking Large Array Processing

// You are given a very large array containing around 100,000 items that must be processed. 
// Your task is to implement a strategy that performs this processing without blocking the main thread, ensuring the browser UI remains responsive. 
// The solution should break the work into smaller chunks and schedule them asynchronously.
async function processLargeArray(items, processFn) {}

module.exports = processLargeArray;
