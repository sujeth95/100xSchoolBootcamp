// Problem Description – Time-Limited Async Function

// You are given an asynchronous function and a time limit t in milliseconds.
// Your task is to wrap this function so that it either resolves normally if it completes within the given time or rejects 
// with the message "Time Limit Exceeded" if execution takes longer than t.
function timeLimit(fn, t) {}
