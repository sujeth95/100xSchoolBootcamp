// Problem Description – Custom Implementation of Promise.all

// You are required to implement your own version of Promise.all without using the built-in method. 
// The function should accept an array of values that may include Promises or plain constants. 
// It must resolve with an array of results in the same order once all inputs resolve, or reject immediately if any input rejects.
function promiseAll(promises) {}

module.exports = promiseAll;
