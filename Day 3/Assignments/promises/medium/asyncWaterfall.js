// Problem Description – Chained Async Function Execution

// You are required to implement a function that accepts an array of asynchronous functions. 
// Each function should be executed only after the previous one has completed, and it should receive the resolved result of the previous function as its input. 
// The final output should be the result of the last function in the chain.
