// Problem Description – switchMap(apiCall)

// You are required to implement a utility function named switchMap to handle rapidly triggered asynchronous requests, such as those from a search input.
// When multiple calls are made in quick succession, only the result of the most recent call should be used. 
// If an earlier request resolves after a later one, its result must be ignored

function switchMap(apiCall) {}

module.exports = switchMap;
