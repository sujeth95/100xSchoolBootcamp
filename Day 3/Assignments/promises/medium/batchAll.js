// Problem Description – batchAll(tasks, batchSize)

// You are required to implement a function named batchAll that processes an array of asynchronous tasks in fixed-size batches. 
// Each batch should execute its tasks concurrently, but the next batch must not start until all tasks in the current batch have completed.
async function batchAll(tasks, batchSize) {}

module.exports = batchAll;
