## Running Tests

### For Hard-Level Assignments
1. Navigate to `/Javascript-Assignments/01-async-js`.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run specific tests with:
   ```sh
   npm run <test-name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```sh
   npm run 1-promisify-setTimeout
   ```
4. To execute all tests at once, run:
   ```sh
   npm run all
   ```

### For Easy & Medium Assignments
- There are no automated tests.
- Manually run scripts using Node.js:
  ```sh
  node easy/1-counter.js
  ```
  (Replace `1-counter.js` with the relevant file name.)
- Follow the same approach for medium problems.
